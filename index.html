            <h2>Why I began Coding</h2>
            <p id="introToCoding">In the summer of 2022 I came across a subreddit called r/Overemployed. I learned about people who would work multiple remote jobs and collect multiple salaries in complete secrecy. I've always had a facination with programming. I decided, instead of rotting my brain watching YouTube videos and playing games on my phone that would put my spare time to use and learn a new trade.</p>
